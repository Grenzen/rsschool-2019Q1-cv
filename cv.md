###3. Summary:

	I'm 24 years old, married, have a child. I've got an incomplete higher philological education in BSU.

	I was a full-time student, later transferred to part-time, but at the end of the second year picked up the documents, because the priority was money and self-sufficiency.

	Love of literature and professional interests diverged, that's why I improved my knowledge as a bartender-barista, completed professional courses, changed several jobs.

	In general, before maternity leave, I've been working in the catering industry for a period of six years (starting in 2010) in various positions, from the seller to the coffee-coach of the coffee shop franchising network.

	I change my job because I want to work on something durable and important. I want to learn, grow and enjoy what I do. Possibilities of creating new things inspire me. This is a challenge to myself and my abilities.

###4. Skills:

	Basic knowledge C and JS/HTML/CSS.
