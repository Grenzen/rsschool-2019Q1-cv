          <h3>Summary:</h3>
          <p>I'm 24 years old, married, have a child. I've got an incomplete higher philological education in BSU.
            <br>
            I was a full-time student, later transferred to part-time, but at the end of the second year  
            picked up the documents, because the priority was money and self-sufficiency.
            <br>
            Love of literature and professional interests diverged, that's why I improved my knowledge  
            as a bartender-barista, completed professional courses, changed several jobs.
            <br>
            In general, before maternity leave, I've been working in the catering industry for a period  
	          of six years (starting in 2010) in various positions, from the seller to the  coffee-coach  
            of the coffee shop franchising network.
            <br>
            I change my job because I want to work on something durable and important. I want to learn, 
	          grow and enjoy what I do. Possibilities of creating new things inspire me.
            This is a challenge to myself and my abilities.
